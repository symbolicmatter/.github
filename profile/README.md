# Symbolic Matter

Symbolic Matter is a **research-driven studio** exploring the intersection of
software design, meaning, and emerging AI-assisted development practices.

The work published here focuses on a central question:

> How do we preserve intent, coherence, and responsibility  
> when software is increasingly produced by machines?

Rather than tools or frameworks, Symbolic Matter publishes
**conceptual models, workflows, and reference material**
intended to support serious experimentation and reflection.

## Core published work

### Context-Driven Engineering (CDE)

**Context-Driven Engineering** is a conceptual framework and school of thought
that treats **context as the primary artifact** in software development,
with code as a secondary, derived outcome.

It focuses on making design intent explicit, durable, and reviewable
in AI-assisted engineering environments.

### Context-Driven Development Workflow (CDDW)

**Context-Driven Development Workflow** is a practical, opinionated workflow
that operationalizes CDE ideas in day-to-day development work.

It treats **learning as a first-class artifact** and introduces explicit
capture and consolidation loops to preserve coherence over time.
